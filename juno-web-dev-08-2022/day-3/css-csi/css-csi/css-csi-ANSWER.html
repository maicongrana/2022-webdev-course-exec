		/* WHERE THE FUN STARTS: */

		/* 
		There are some styles in this stylesheet that are not applying to the page properly. Go through each one and see if you can uncover the problem. 
		*/


		/* 
		The font-size of this h1 should be 65px, but it's not applying properly. Without changing the selector, make this rule apply. Which of three CSS concepts is causing this problem? 
		*/

		h1 {
			font-size: 65px;
		}

		/* Answer: the cascade is causing the font property below to override above. Delete the h1 from the mutli-element selector below. */
	
		h2,
		h3 {
			font-size: 32px;
		}

		/*
		Now that we've fixed the font-size of the h1, we can see that the following rule is no longer applying properly and the magnifying glass is way too big. What's wrong with the following selector?
		*/

		/* Answer: Did you catch the little typo? Change .magifying-glass to .magnifying-glass */

		.magnifying-glass {
			margin-right: 10px;
			font-size: 40px;
		}

		/* 
		The following rule block is not applying. Can you figure out what's wrong with this selector?
		HINT: take a look at the HTML markup.
		*/

    /* Answer: There are no h5 tags on the page! They're h4 tags. Replace h5 with h4. */

		h4 {
			margin-top: 20px;
			font-size: 18px;
			font-style: italic;
		}

		/* 
		The list-style property changes the little dots beside each list item. A list-style value of none removes the dots entirely. Can you fix this selector to make the style apply?
		*/

    /* 
		Answer: reverse the order of the ul and li because li is a child of ul, and not the other way around. 
		*/

		ul li {
			list-style: none;
		}


		/* 
		The following rule is not applying to the paragraphs with a class of fact. Correct this selector to fix the problem. 
		*/
    
		/* 
		Answer: As it stood, the rule was looking for paragraphs that were children of an element with a class of fact. p.fact targets paragraphs with a class of fact. 
		*/

		p.fact {
			font-size: 24px;
		}

		
		/*
		Write a new rule so that applies the background color slategray to the background of the paragraph elements in the information section AND the background of the entire section with a class of show-statistics.
		*/

		.information p,
		.show-statistics {
			background-color: slategrey;
		}


		/* 
		Replace the blank with the selector that will target the paragraph element in the footer.
		*/

    /* Answer: The most general tag that will do this is footer, though footer p can also work. */
		footer,
		a {
			color: white;
		}

		/* 
		Anchor tags do not naturally accept properties through inheritance. Because of this you'll need to explicitly state that the anchor tag should be white. Change the previous rule to accomplish this. 
		*/

		/* Answer: Add a as a selector for the previous rule. */

		/* 
		BONUS: Write a new rule that removes the underline on the anchor tag and makes it bold. You may want to look online for help.
		*/

		a {
			text-decoration: none;
			font-weight: bold;

					<h4>Fingerprints Aren't Foolproof</h4>
					<p>Fingerprints are <span>almost</span> entirely unique to each individual in the world. However, there have been cases where the wrong person has gone to trial all based on an incorrectly matched fingerprint. Fingerprints are so intricate and variable, it takes incredible training and expertise to be able to identify a match.</p>

				<li>
					<h4>Teeth are Trustworthy</h4>
					<p>Dental records are responsible for identifying 93% of human remains. Bones are incredibly resilient, and all humans have a completely unique dental imprint.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Deleted Computer Files Arenâ€™t Always Gone</h4>
					<p>Savvy forensic scientists may be able to find evidence thatâ€™s been deleted from a computer. Every time you "delete" a file from a computer, the file is simply set aside, hidden, and marked as data waiting to be rewritten. So keep that in mind next time you're trying to delete your sensitive information!</p>
